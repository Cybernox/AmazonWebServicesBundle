# Amazon Web Services Bundle #

This is a Symfony 2 Bundle for interfacing with Amazon Web Services (AWS).

This bundle utilizes the [AWS SDK for PHP](http://github.com/amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php) by loading the SDK and providing the means to instantiate the SDK's various web service objects, passing them back to you for direct use.

For installation, configuration, and usage details, please see the Resources/doc folder.

This Bundle can be used in order to use Amazon S3 and CloudFront as a CDN in a 
Symfony2 application. More details in Resources/doc/cdn.md .
